## Quantization of neural networks for NLP tasks

This repository allows to train and evaluate the performance of neural networks used for NLP tasks.

### Evaluation options

One can choose the neural network architecture (CNN for texts or BERT classifier) and quantization type (dynamic post-training, static post-training, quantization-aware training).

### Data

Training and evaluation are performed using IMDB Dataset.
